							<h2>Cabintine</h2>
						</header>
						<p>In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the novel coronavirus seems to be the only topic of conversation.  A tidal wave of statistics, fatality rates, and haunting predictions of the future consumes our media and has placed a cloud of uncertainty over the world.  I was inspired to make project related to COVID-19, but I did not want to make a typical visual exploring numbers of cases or deaths, as there are plenty out there already; I wanted this to be more human and personal.  Thus, I am using a self dataset:  a log of my friends and my time in quarantine since school was dismissed.  We stayed together in a remote cabin and kept a daily log of how we handled new patterns of daily life.  The dataset contains an entry for each day that has a day title, highlights and key events, a quote someone said that day, all of our mental states (a rating of the day or how we feel on a scale of 1-10), and a descriptive word for our day.  My goal for the project is to capture this moment in time and take a look at how we as a group of college students were affected by the situation.</p>
						<p>Inspired by the creative outpouring of people stuck at home, I chose to make a data physicalization (a physical representation of data) for this project out of found materials, using mostly cereal boxes and cardboard, to represent the data.  Without access to modern fabrication tools, like 3D printing or laser cutting, everything was made by hand and all of the color and text was hand-painted.</p>
                        <hr />
                        <h3>Project Description</h3>
                        <div class="images">
                            <img src="images/angled_top.png" alt="Image of Cabintine without bars." height="265" > 
                            <img src="images/front_filled_angled.png" alt="Image of Cabintine with all bars." height="265" > 
                        </div>
                        
						<p>What I ultimately created was a 3 axis bar chart of the mental states.  On one axis is the cabin members, labeled as numbered comrades for anonymity, and the other axis shows the day, starting with Day 1 on March 16th, when people first started moving into the cabin.  The z axis represents the comrades’ mental states for each day with the height of the bar equaling the mental state in inches. I include a backboard line chart showing the daily averages.  Also on the backboard are icons representing some of the key events that happened throughout the time in the cabin, such as more people arriving, celebrating Comrade 4’s birthday, zoom classes starting or our internet going out and suspending virtual learning for a few hours.</p>
                        
                        <p>There are 3 main modes of interacting with the piece.

                            The first, is flipping through the icons on the backboard.  Behind each icon is a short description of what it represents.  
                            
                            The second, and main, mode of interacting with the visual is physically moving and touching the bars.  Each bar is removable, affording users flexibility to add and remove the bars as desired.  This allows for a physical filtering where any a subset of the total bars can placed and users are not limited to filtering capabilities encoded by the designer.  Additionally, bars can be picked up, inspected, and physically compared to other bars in the chart.  
                            
                            The final mode of interaction is the joystick that controls text on the LCD display.  This allows users to click through all the day names and the comrade’s daily words.</p>
